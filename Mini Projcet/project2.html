        <h2>A Peaceful Visite To The Temple</h2>
    
      <article>28Feb day friday Today i visited a beautiful temple and the atmosphere<br> there felt truly divine. Right at the entrance stone a massive ancient tree spreading <br>its branches like a natural umbrella. it looked so majestic, almost as<br> if lord of vishnu himself rested beneath its shade. nearby, there were very large<br> and detailed idols, each carved with great devotion and artistry.<br> the combination of the scared tree, the calm surroundings,and <br>the impressive sculptures made the entire place feel spiritual and peacefull.<br> it was an experience that filled my heart with positivity and awe.</article>
